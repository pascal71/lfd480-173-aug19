Conclusion:

In Rust, mutable ownership allows you to modify a variable after its creation. By using the mut keyword,
you can make a String variable mutable and then modify its content using methods like .push_str().
This feature is key to Rust's memory safety, ensuring that only mutable variables can be changed,
preventing accidental modifications of immutable data.
