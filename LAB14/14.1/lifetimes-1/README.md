Explanation:

    Lifetime Annotations ('a):
        The struct AuthorAndExcerpt<'a> is annotated with a lifetime parameter 'a. This indicates that both author and excerpt are references with the same lifetime 'a.
        This ensures that the AuthorAndExcerpt struct cannot outlive the references it holds, avoiding dangling references.

    new_author_and_excerpt Function:
        The function new_author_and_excerpt takes two string slices, author and excerpt, both with the same lifetime 'a.
        It returns an instance of AuthorAndExcerpt<'a> initialized with the provided string slices.
