Explanation:

    Lifetime Annotation ('a):
        The Person struct is annotated with a lifetime parameter 'a, which indicates that the name field is a reference that must live at least as long as the 'a lifetime.
        The make_person function also uses the same lifetime 'a for its input parameter and return type. This ensures that the Person struct returned by the function will not outlive the reference it holds to name.

    Function Signature:
        The make_person function is defined with a lifetime parameter 'a, which is applied to both the input parameter name: &'a str and the return type Person<'a>. This ensures that the lifetime of the reference inside the Person struct is tied to the lifetime of the input reference.
